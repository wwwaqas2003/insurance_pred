# 💰 Insurance Cost Predictor 🧾

A modern and responsive **web application** that predicts the estimated insurance cost based on user input such as age, BMI, number of children, smoker status, gender, and region. Built using **Flask**, **Random Forest Regressor**, and styled with **Bootstrap 5** for a polished frontend experience.

## 🧠 Model Training

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
import pandas as pd
import joblib

df = pd.read_csv("insurance.csv")
df['sex'] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(df['sex'])
df['smoker'] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(df['smoker'])
df.replace({'region': {'southeast': 0, 'southwest': 1, 'northeast': 2, 'northwest': 3}}, inplace=True)

X = df.drop(columns='charges', axis=1)
y = df['charges']

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=2)

model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'insurance_model.joblib')

# Evaluation
train_pred = model.predict(x_train)
test_pred = model.predict(x_test)

print("Train R² Score:", r2_score(y_train, train_pred))
print("Test R² Score:", r2_score(y_test, test_pred))
```

> ✅ R² Score (Train): ~0.97  
> ✅ R² Score (Test): ~0.83
